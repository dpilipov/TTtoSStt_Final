# TTtoSStt_Final
We are considering pair produced vector like tops where each decays to a top quark and a new scalar, with consequent diphoton decay of one of the two scalars while second is treated inclusively, $TT\to tt\phi\phi, \phi\to\gamma\gamma$.  This branch covers the necessary analysis steps, from generating snapshots based on initial selection to obtaining the final selection / regions.

# Overall Analysis Strategy
We use JHU's TIMBER, which takes advantage of RDataFrame to process data fast, and to implement other CMS-related functionality, in order to  obtain the final selection shapes across the various regions of a 2-d mass space.  The consequent steps of fitting a model, a variation on the ABCD method, are covered in a separate branch, and take advantage of 2DAlphabet, again edited for the specific needs of this analysis.

The code here originates from Amitav Mitra's code for single production $T\to t\phi$ code, with specific edits for pair production and final state.  The edits are covered both in the README documentation here. as well as in the actual code.

# Set up TIMBER/analysis area
To set up the environment, including TIMBER and the analysis area we follow the same steps as for Amitav's set up for TopHBoostedAllHad which was edited and supplemented for pair production (take a look at https://github.com/ammitra/TIMBER and https://github.com/ammitra/TopHBoostedAllHad).  However, to make sure you have the required TIMBER edits and the required code for pair production you must clone TIMBER and TTtoSStt_Final from my area:

```
cmssw-el7 -p --bind `readlink $HOME` --bind `readlink -f ${HOME}/nobackup/` --bind /uscms_data --bind /cvmfs
export SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc820 
mkdir yourAnalysisDirName
cd yourAnalysisDirName/
cmsrel CMSSW_11_1_4
cd CMSSW_11_1_4/src
cmsenv

git clone https://github.com/dpilipov/TIMBER.git
python -m virtualenv timber-env
source timber-env/bin/activate
cd TIMBER
source setup.sh
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/dpilipov/TTtoSStt_Final.git
cd TTtoSStt_Final
```
IMPORTANT NOTE!  HEM_drop.cc (see TIMBER/Framework/include for HEM_drop.h and TIMBER/Framework/src for HEM_drop.cc) is NOT used for the pair production analysis!  Instead, HEM_dropData and HEM_dropMC code is now included in TTmodules.cc, and is used for correcting for HEM in 2018.  During TIMBER setup you will get an error regarding HEM_drop.cc which you can ignore.

# Work in a container
Whenever you work in this area you need to use the container and set up the environment.  For example, 
```
cmssw-el7 -p --bind `readlink $HOME` --bind `readlink -f ${HOME}/nobackup/` --bind /uscms_data --bind /cvmfs
cd /uscms/home/dpilipov/nobackup/TIMBER/CMSSW_11_1_4/src
cmsenv
source timber-env/bin/activate
cd TIMBER
source setup.sh
cd ..
cd TTtoSStt_Final
voms-proxy-init --rfc --voms cms -valid 192:00                          
```
(Note, actually my work area is in /uscms/home/dpilipov/nobackup/TIMBER/CMSSW_11_1_4/src/TopHBoostedAllHad, hence, technically I would cd to TopHBoostedAllHad instead of TTtoSStt_Final above.)

**NOTE:** All the steps follow the same process as what is shown for https://github.com/ammitra/TopHBoostedAllHad in README.  Please use this as a reference.  The variations across the steps are explained below.

## 0. Generic TTClassdR, TTClassdR18, TTClassdRVR, TTClassdR18VR, and TTClassdRData
The preselection is specific to the pair production and final state and thus differs from https://github.com/ammitra/TopHBoostedAllHad in some details.  Most of the edits to accomodate this difference are denoted as 'DP edit' in the code.

The TTClassdR modules hold all of the basic, generic logic to perform the selection.
Any additions, modifications, splittings, or saving of the selection should be added here.
Subsequent steps should always interface with this so that if something is changed, it's propagated
to the full pipeline.

For MC processing in SR/CR use TTClassdR for 2016-2017 and for 2018 use TTClassdR18.  For VR use the VR versions.  For data use the Data version.

All the TTClassdR take advantage of functions provided by TTmodules.cc.

## 1. Grab latest raw NanoAOD file locations
--------------
Same as in https://github.com/ammitra/TopHBoostedAllHad:

The list of file locations in `raw_nano/` can be easily populated with
```
python raw_nano/get_all_lpc.py
```
If one wishes to add to the sets considered, simply modify the dictionary
in `raw_nano/get_all_lpc.py` with the name of the set and the DAS path.

## 2. Create pileup distributions for pileup weights
------------------
Same as in https://github.com/ammitra/TopHBoostedAllHad:

This is handled by THpileup.py.
```
python THpileup.py -s <setname> -y <year>
```
This script simply draws into a histogram the
distribution of the number of primary vertices in the set. This is relatively quick
but not quick enough to include in every snapshot or to run interactively.
To run with condor, use...
```
python CondorHelper.py -r condor/run_pileup.sh -a condor/pileup_args.txt -i "THpileup.py raw_nano/"
```
To collect the outputs to one local file called `THpileup.root`, use `scripts/get_pileup_file.sh`.

**NOTE:** Please follow instructions in https://github.com/ammitra/TopHBoostedAllHad to setup condor correctly.

## 3. Perform snapshot on `raw_nano/` files
-------------
The command to perform one snapshot using `THsnapshot.py` is 
```
python THsnapshot.py -s <setname> -y <16,17,18> -j <ijob> -n <njobs>
```
where `<ijob>` and `<njobs>` determine the job number and the number of jobs to split into and default
to 1 and 1, respectively.

### Condor
-----------
#### Preparing an archived environment
---------
The `condor/tar_env.sh` script will create a tarball of the current environment and store
it on EOS. 

- **NOTE 1:** You may need to modify this if you are not on LPC or wish to store the tarball somewhere else.
- **NOTE 2:** If you are a TIMBER developer, you need to rerun this script everytime you change TIMBER to
ensure the condor node has your latest changes.
#### Arguments file
--------------
To generate the arguments to submit to condor, use `python condor/snapshot_args.py` which will
dynamically read the contents of `raw_nano/` to create a list of arguments for condor in `condor/snapshot_args.txt`.
This script will also split sets into N/2 jobs where N is the total number of raw NanoAOD files. This splitting is
quite aggressive to keep job runtimes under the 4 hour mark and can be changed as needed.

#### Bash script to run on condor node
----------------
The script that will run on the node is `condor/run_snapshot.sh`. You may need to modify it to suit your needs
but even without modifications, one needs to ensure that the `topHBoostedAllHad` exists on their EOS space.
To create it on LPC, run
```
eosmkdir /store/user/<username>/topHBoostedAllHad
```

Then, create the `snapshot` and `selection` directories afterwards:
```
eosmkdir /store/user/<username>/topHBoostedAllHad/snapshot
eosmkdir /store/user/<username>/topHBoostedAllHad/selection
```

#### Submission
------------
To submit to condor, create a symbolic link to TIMBER's CondorHelper.py,
```
ln -s $TIMBERPATH/TIMBER/Utilities/Condor/CondorHelper.py
```

Then run 
```
python CondorHelper.py -r condor/run_snapshot.sh -a condor/snapshot_args.txt -i "THClass.py THsnapshot.py helpers.py"
```
where `-i` argument is just an example of how to ship local scripts that you may have changed
between now and when you last ran `condor/tar_env.sh`. You can add or remove the files here as you
see fit.

To check on jobs, run `condor_q <username>` or use 
`python condor/check_jobs.py -t <tasknumber>` to generate a dynamic report on all jobs, including
a list of those that have failed for easy re-running (see more below).

**NOTE:** This step assumes you have performed the previous steps of creating an environment tarball and creating a list of
jobs to submit in the condor task.

## 4. Collect condor snapshot outputs
-----------------
Job outputs will automatically be moved to your EOS in the `condor/run_snapshot.sh` script that runs
per-job on the condor nodes. The information for these can be collected with
```
python dijet_nano/get_all.py
```
This script will dynamically search the EOS folder where the outputs are stored and populate the lists
based on these.

**NOTE** this means that only jobs that have finished successfully will be grabbed. If
a job is still running or failed, it will not be included.

**NOTE2:** It has been determined that Run 2017B lacks substructure- and grooming-based triggers that the rest of 2017 has, resulting in low efficiencies for 2017 if included in the whole dataset. Therefore, the `get_all.py` script will create a concatenated file with all runs in 2017, but the main `Data_17_snapshot.txt` and `SingleMuonData_17_snapshot.txt` files will *not* include the run 2017B files.

### Checking job success
------------------
The most fool-proof method is to read the stdout/stderr of each job but this is of course very time consuming.
A helper script (which is not promised to be fool-proof!) that can automate the most basic checks is 
provided in `python condor/check_jobs.py -t <tasknumber>`. The task* number is reported at several points
but can be found in two ways post-submission depending on the stage of your jobs.
- If your jobs are still running, the return of `condor_q <username>` will show lines like those
below where `12513846` is the task number.
```
-- Schedd: lpcschedd1.fnal.gov : <131.225.188.55:9618?... @ 04/20/21 14:56:24
 ID          OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE  CMD

12513846.65  lcorcodi        4/19 23:03   0+15:49:21 R  0   625.0 run_snapshot.sh -s ttbar -y 16

Total for query: 2 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 0 idle, 2 running, 0 held, 0 suspended 
Total for all users: 4650 jobs; 0 completed, 114 removed, 111 idle, 1866 running, 2559 held, 0 suspended
```

- If your jobs are complete, the outputs in `logs/` will have the task number in their names. For a file
named `logs/output_12513846_51.stdout`, the task number is again `12513846`.

The `condor/check_jobs.py` will check for python errors in the `stderr` as well as the final
time-to-finish number reported at the end of successful job in `stdout`. It will collect information
on jobs finished, failed, and still running (if they exist) and prepare a report (`logs/report_<tasknumber>.txt`) which includes
job runtimes (for those that have finished), a new set of arguments for resubmission of failed jobs (`logs/jobsToReRun_<tasknumber>.txt`),
and jobs still running.

One can check why a job is being held with `condor_q <task>.<job> -name <sched> -af HoldReason`.

If the job has hit memory constraints, one can request more memory without resubmission with the 
command `condor_qedit <task>.<job> -name <sched> RequestMemory 4000` (which increases memory to 4000 MB, default is 2000 MB).

\* A "task" is the basket that "jobs" fall into - one `CondorHelper.py` call creates one "task" with several "jobs".

## 5. Making the trigger efficiencies
----------------------------
The trigger efficiency is measured in the SingleMuon dataset separately for the three years, using the `HLT_Mu50` trigger as a reference. It was discovered that, during run 2017B certain substructure- and grooming-based triggers were not available. Therefore, including run 2017B into the total 2017 dataset caused the efficiency of the entire year to drop dramatically. Therefore, the efficiency is measured separately for 2017B, but this run is dropped from the total 2017 dataset when measuring the efficiency for the whole year. Run 2017B accounts for ~12% of the total 2017 JetHT dataset and ~8% of the total SingleMuon dataset, after preselection/snapshotting (see `scripts/check2017fraction.py`). Therefore, we apply the 2017B efficiency to 12% of the 2017MC to account for this difference in efficiency (see the main function in `THselection.py`).

The triggers used in this analysis are as follows:
| Dataset  | Triggers |
| -------- | -------- |
| 2016  | `HLT_PFHT800`, `HLT_PFHT900`  |
| 2017B | `HLT_PFHT1050`, `HLT_AK8PFJet500` |
| 2017  | `HLT_PFHT1050`, `HLT_AK8PFJet500`, `HLT_AK8PFHT750_TrimMass50`, `HLT_AK8PFHT800_TrimMass50`, `HLT_AK8PFJet400_TrimMass30` |
| 2018  | `HLT_PFHT1050`, `HLT_AK8PFJet400_TrimMass30`, `HLT_AK8PFHT850_TrimMass50` |


<details>
<summary>Old trigger efficiency info (pre Sept. 23, 2022 - before OR)</summary>
<br>

The choice of triggers to use per year was made using the TrigTester.py utility in TIMBER.
First the data snapshots were hadd-ed to backfill any empty trigger entries from sub-year eras.
```
hadd THsnapshot_Data_<year>.root THsnapshot_Data*_<year>_*.root 
```

The utility was then used with the following commands,
```
python ../TIMBER/TIMBER/Utilities/TrigTester.py -i ../dijet_nano_files/THsnapshot_Data_16.root -o Data16Trig
python ../TIMBER/TIMBER/Utilities/TrigTester.py -i ../dijet_nano_files/THsnapshot_Data_16.root -o Data16Trig_1 --not "HLT_PFHT800||HLT_PFHT900"

python ../TIMBER/TIMBER/Utilities/TrigTester.py -i ../dijet_nano_files/THsnapshot_Data_17.root -o Data17Trig
python ../TIMBER/TIMBER/Utilities/TrigTester.py -i ../dijet_nano_files/THsnapshot_Data_17.root -o Data17Trig_1 --not "HLT_PFHT1050"
python ../TIMBER/TIMBER/Utilities/TrigTester.py -i ../dijet_nano_files/THsnapshot_Data_17.root -o Data17Trig_2 --not "HLT_PFHT1050||HLT_AK8PFJet500"

python ../TIMBER/TIMBER/Utilities/TrigTester.py -i ../dijet_nano_files/THsnapshot_Data_18.root -o Data18Trig 
python ../TIMBER/TIMBER/Utilities/TrigTester.py -i ../dijet_nano_files/THsnapshot_Data_18.root -o Data18Trig_1 --not "HLT_AK8PFJet400_TrimMass30"
python ../TIMBER/TIMBER/Utilities/TrigTester.py -i ../dijet_nano_files/THsnapshot_Data_18.root -o Data18Trig_2 --not "HLT_AK8PFJet400_TrimMass30||HLT_AK8PFHT850_TrimMass50"
```

The script produces text output as well as a plot to show which triggers lead
to the greatest acceptance of events in the provided selection (dijet in this case). The successive
iterations per-year with the addition of the `--not` arguement are done to study what "next" trigger
should be added if the `--not` triggers are vetoed. If one were to choose their nth trigger (where n>1)
based on the initial plot, they may choose one that is mostly degenerate with the 1st. By vetoing the first,
one can see which triggers are most efficient at picking up events that do `--not` make the selection
of the first trigger.

For this analysis, we have chosen:
```python
self.trigs = {
    16:['HLT_PFHT800','HLT_PFHT900'],
    17:['HLT_PFHT1050','HLT_AK8PFJet500'],
    18:['HLT_AK8PFJet400_TrimMass30','HLT_AK8PFHT850_TrimMass50','HLT_PFHT1050']
}
```

To calculate the trigger efficiencies with Clopper-Pearson errors, one can simply run
```
python THtrigger2D.py
```

The script outputs one ROOT file per year. Inside are the 2D histograms (which do NOT store the errors) and the 
TEfficiency loaded by TIMBER later on (which do have the errors). Plots are also made in the `plots/` directory.

Five variations are created per-year. 
1. Dijet-only selection ("Pretag")
2. DeepAK8 top tag
3. DeepAK8 top anti-tag (for validation region)
4. ParticleNet top tag
5. ParticleNet top anti-tag (for validation region)

We select the pretag version since it is the smoothest and all variations are in agreement with one another.
</details>

## 7. Running Selection
Run the selection on condor, since the number of files is truly enormous. The script `perform_selection.py` will run all selections with all variations locally, but there is a strange bug which affects every ~20th selection job and causing a segfault during Higgs tagging. The script can be re-run and it will skip existing files. But instead, it's best to run on condor. 

To do so, first create the `selection` directory on your EOS under `/store/user/<username>/topHBoostedAllHad/selection`. Then, proceed with the following steps:

1. First, ensure that you've run `THtrigger2D.py` and the resulting ROOT files exist in the base directory
2. Ensure that the snapshot file locations exist in the `dijet_nano/` directory via `python dijet_nano/get_all.py`
3. Send a tarball of the current environment to EOS via `source condor/tar_env.sh`
4. Run `source condor/selection_args.py` to generate the arguments for selection
5. Send the jobs to condor via the command `python CondorHelper.py -r condor/run_selection.sh -a condor/selection_args.txt -i "THselection.py"`
6. Run the script `rootfiles/get_all.py` to gather all the rootfiles locally, and automatically combine common sets (V+Jets, ttbar, QCD, Data) for 2Dalphabet. 

## 8. Gathering Cutflow Information
To get information on yields after all important cuts, run `python cutflowSummary.py`. If you pass the optional `--selection` flag, then the script will calculate the yields after the selection criteria as well. One can also calculate the signal efficiencies for select signals by adding calling `printEfficiencies()` in the main function. **(TODO: implement this option via flag arg)**

The number of events are recorded after each of the following cuts:

Snapshot phase:
* `NPROC`: Initial number of processed events
* `NFLAGS`: Cut on MET filters
* `NJETS`: Cut on `nFatJets > 2`
* `NJETID`: Cut on tight `Jet_jetId`
* `NPT`: Cut on lead/sublead pT
* `NKIN`: Cut on all other kinematic variables

Selection phase:
* `nTop_CR/SR`: Top cut in CR/SR
* `higgsF/L/P_CR/SR`: Higgs cut in fail/loose/pass regions in CR/SR

## Kinematic distributions
After having run snapshots, run `python dijet_nano/get_all.py` to populate the directory with the snapshot locations. Then, run `python THdistributions.py -y <year>` to generate kinematic distribution histograms in the `rootfiles/` directory. To plot, just run `python kinDistPlotter.py -y <year>`. **NOTE:** the plotting script only works with python3 since it uses fancy matplotlib things instead of ROOT. 


# DEPRECATED 

##  Final selections and studies
Once you are sure the snapshots are finished and available and their locations have been accessed,
the basic selection can be performed with `python THselection.py -s <setname> -y <year>`. This script
will take in the corresponding txt file in `dijet_nano/*.txt` and perform the basic signal region and "fail" region
selections and makes 2D histograms for 2D Alphabet. However, any other selection or study 
can follow a similar format to perform more complicated manipulation of the snapshots (ex. THstudies.py and THjetstudies.py).

The processing of all sets in `dijet_nano/` can be performed in parallel with THplotter.py.

We originally generated only local samples to play with and better understand how the model works.  Ultimately, we requested centrally produced samples.   These are readily available (as NanoAODs) for you to take a look.  For example, for M_T = 1000GeV and M_S = 100GeV you can look at the available samples on DAS:
'''
dataset=/TprimeTprimeToSSTTTo2ASTT_MTprime-1000_MS-100_TuneCP5_13TeV-madgraph-pythia8/*/*
'''
On DAS you will find samples for M_T = 800 to 1500GeV and M_S=50 to 350GeV.  We expanded our M_T mass range during ARC review to include additional M_T points, up to 1800GeV.  These are locally generated, and you can find them in /store/user/dpilipov/TTtoSStt/* organized by periods.
